        "saying": "I am very impressed with the construction process of ChauSaDec. Their team of engineers and workers are very professional, from the planning and design phase to the completion of the project. After I shared my requirements and desires for the garden space, they made very reasonable suggestions that helped me visualize a harmonious green space that complements the house.",
        "saying2": "One notable point about ChauSaDec is the quality of the ornamental plants they provide. I purchased several types of decorative plants for my garden and indoor living spaces from this company, and I am truly satisfied with the quality of the plants. All the plants are healthy, beautiful, and well-cared for. Additionally, the company offers bonsai trees, landscape plants, and various types of plants suitable for different design styles."
